 * saved out to data tables line by line. 
 * 
 * The iff File has header rows which have the column names, followed by some number of data rows. 
 * There may be multiple Header/Data row groups in a single file. 
 * The files are tab delimited. 
 * The header rows are itentified by the first character "!" 
 * The first column of each line names the table that will recieve the data.
